# 2250font

Recreation of the IBM 2250 terminal font.

The 2250 was an early graphics-capable terminal with a vector display. It had local memory, from which it refreshed the display. It had also text capabilities, so that characters didn't need to be decomposed into their vectors for display.

## References

This recreation draws upon many different document sources, most notably:

- [IBM Field Engineering Theory of Operation - 2250 Display Unit Model 1](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/2250/Y27-2043-0_2250_FETOM_Sep66.pdf), Appendix D

- [IBM 2250 display with light pen and text from Hypertext Editing System (HES)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HES_IBM_2250_light_pen_grlloyd_Oct1969.png), visual detail of lowercase characters

## Thanks

This work would take a lot longer if Lynn Grant, a security consultant with a deep understanding of mainframe arcane knowledge, hadn't corrected my misunderstanging of the X-Y tables.
